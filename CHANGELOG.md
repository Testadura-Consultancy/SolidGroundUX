# Changelog

All notable changes to SolidGroundUX are documented in this file.

The format is inspired by *Keep a Changelog* while remaining focused on practical framework development.

## Backlog

- Scan Framework, SDK and Management Console Modules for hard-coded `/usr/local/share/solidgroundux` references and migrate appropriate usages to the canonical `SGND_SHARE_DIR` framework variable.

## Unreleased

## Release 2.1.2627801

### Added

- Added standalone `sgnd-setup` as the product lifecycle entry point for first installation, local/GitHub updates, rollback, removal, and package management; `sgnd-release-manager` remains available as a compatibility alias.
- Added a product-centric Setup dashboard showing installed, newest local, and newest GitHub releases per known product, with newer availability highlighted.
- Added local package discovery beside the running Setup script and in the canonical releases directory, plus action-scoped selection of another package directory.
- Added canonical `Shortname` support to comment-header metadata. `sgnd_module_init_metadata` now uses the header Shortname when present and falls back to the normalized source filename when it is absent.
- Added metadata-driven current-script aliases so executable metadata such as Title, Description, Version and Build can be derived from canonical parsed header metadata instead of being repeated as hard-coded runtime literals.
- Added configurable `SGND_MENU_Q_EXIT` behavior to the reusable menu layer so applications can disable `Q/q` exit handling while preserving the historical default for other menu consumers.
- Added canonical `SGND_SHARE_DIR`, rebased as `$SGND_FRAMEWORK_ROOT/usr/local/share/<product>`, as the framework path for shared product data in installed and staged/development trees.
- Added framework-owned `sgnd-repair-permissions.sh`, which applies declarative ownership and mode rules from `permissions.dta` in `SGND_SHARE_DIR` by default. Rules support files or directories, exact targets, direct-child masks, recursive `**` selection, ordinary glob masks, and symbolic `operator` ownership.
- Added an initial `permissions.dta` policy covering SolidGroundUX `libexec` executables, public `sgnd*` command wrappers, and the operator-writable documentation cache.

### Changed

- Standardized product ZIPs as the release unit: acquisition may come from GitHub, the canonical local package store, or another directory, but all selected packages enter the same validation/install pipeline.
- Replaced the former bundled-release concept with a first-install transport package containing `sgnd-setup.sh` and normal product release ZIPs; the first-install package has its own Setup Version/Build identity.
- Rebalanced the Setup dashboard columns so full product names fit more naturally and Installed/Local/GitHub values display compact Version.Build identities instead of long release basenames.
- First install now discovers adjacent product ZIPs, admits them to the canonical package store, lets the operator select one or more products, installs through the normal package pipeline, and cleans temporary bootstrap files afterward.
- Successful product installs archive the original ZIP beneath the canonical releases archive while retaining extracted internal release history for rollback/removal.
- Package source paths are transient operation input and are no longer restored or persisted as product/repository state.
- Consolidated runtime metadata initialization around the existing comment-header parser and `sgnd_module_init_metadata`, retaining structural `SGND_SCRIPT_FILE`, `SGND_SCRIPT_DIR`, `SGND_SCRIPT_BASE`, and `SGND_SCRIPT_NAME` as executable-context identity while removing redundant duplicated metadata literals.
- Kept early bootstrap metadata initialization explicit for bootstrap/header-parser/definitions/environment files, while later framework libraries continue to self-initialize metadata once the parser is available.
- Changed first-install completion to offer **Setup**, **Management Console**, or **Exit**, with Exit as the default and `Esc` treated as Exit.
- Kept the first-install completion selector framework-independent so bootstrap/recovery operation does not depend on SolidGroundUX UI helpers before the framework is available.
- Management Console applications can now treat `Esc` as the canonical return/exit control while leaving reusable framework menu behavior configurable for other consumers.
- Shared product-data paths can now be derived from `SGND_SHARE_DIR` instead of repeating `/usr/local/share/solidgroundux` literals.
- Updated Framework-facing README, installation and Constitution documentation to reflect the `sgnd-setup` lifecycle and remove obsolete Release Manager references and stale documentation/image references.

### Fixed

- Fixed comment-header parsing variable shadowing that could prevent parsed banner Product/Title values from propagating correctly into module metadata.
- Fixed non-interactive execution paths that could hang while rendering a title bar through `/dev/tty`; receiver-side execution can now suppress title rendering explicitly with `--no-title`.
- Fixed terminal-width detection fallbacks so framework UI code remains usable when no controlling terminal is available.
- Fixed repeated/non-interactive bootstrap behavior used by deployment receivers so framework startup no longer depends on terminal-only rendering paths.

## Release 2.1.2626712

### Added

- Added configurable warning and error message delays to the Framework globals, with `saywarning` and `sayfail` consuming the configured defaults while allowing an explicit `--delay` override.

### Changed

- Standardized the warning/error delay policy at 0.5 seconds by default; `--delay 0` remains immediate and `--delay -1` waits for a keypress.

### Fixed

- Restored the canonical `sgnd-smoketest` implementation and completed Framework ownership of the public smoke-test command after the product split.

## Release 2.1.2626612

### Added

- Restored the canonical framework locator and library-guard templates lost during the product split.
- Updated the canonical framework locator so development executables can bootstrap `sgnd-exe-common.sh` from the installed Framework when it is not present in the active product overlay.
- Restored the comment-header parser required for module metadata and menu descriptions.
- Moved canonical normalization ownership into the Framework alongside the structures it maintains.
- Added the framework-owned `sgnd-smoketest` public command and standalone smoke-test implementation. The Framework owns framework installation validation and smoke tests; Management Console registration and module validation remain Management Console Modules concerns.
- Added `sgnd_framework_resolve_path` as the common resolver for Framework-owned resources used from Framework, SDK and Management Console development roots. Local Framework resources are preferred only when the contextual root actually contains a Framework; otherwise resolution falls back to the installed Framework.

### Changed

- Completed the product split: the Framework now owns runtime/bootstrap services, reusable APIs, canonical Framework resources and framework smoke testing. The Management Console host/modules are owned by Management Console Modules, while workspace, documentation and release tooling is owned by the SolidGroundUX SDK.
- Kept `SGND_FRAMEWORK_ROOT` as the contextual execution/development root; Framework resource fallback no longer mutates that context or reintroduces the removed application-root model.
- Canonical module metadata now uses the comment header as the source of truth for Version, Build and Description, removing duplicate runtime metadata.
- Framework-owned canonical templates and resources can now be consumed correctly by SDK/MCM tools running from separate non-root development trees.

### Removed

- Removed Framework ownership of `management-console.sh`, `sgnd-console`, Management Console modules, and SDK development/release/documentation commands. Their history remains in earlier releases, but ongoing ownership is now recorded in their respective product changelogs.

### Fixed

- Fixed bootstrap/UI resource resolution after the repository split, including style/palette and license lookup from non-Framework development roots.
- Added the missing bootstrap failure path used by early UI/bootstrap errors.
- Fixed canonical Framework resource fallback so an empty Framework-shaped directory in another product's staged tree is not mistaken for a local Framework installation.
- Fixed module metadata discovery so Management Console modules can remain lazily loaded while their canonical header metadata is still displayed and validated.

## Release 2.1.2626021

### Added

- Added multi-product documentation collections to `doc-generator.sh`. Documentation runs can discover products beneath a development root, select one or more products, and designate a primary product as the lead product for ordering, defaults, and deterministic first-wins behavior.
- Added per-product documentation exclusions through `<product>.docignore`. User configuration takes precedence over system configuration; when neither exists, an example user ignore file can be created without overwriting existing configuration and without writing during dry-run.
- Added duplicate documentation-module detection across selected products. Duplicate module basenames are reported and later occurrences are skipped so combined collections remain deterministic.
- Added per-product documentation asset collection from each selected product's canonical `usr/local/assets` directory. Assets are merged into the generated site's `assets/images` directory, with duplicate filenames retaining the first selected product's asset and producing a warning.
- Added an explicit documentation collection/output model: collection name and output root can be persisted, while the final output directory is derived from a normalized lowercase collection slug and remains overridable per run.
- Added `. Table` / `. EndTable` as an explicit documentation table construct. Table cells are separated with `::`; the first row is rendered semantically as the table header and subsequent rows as table body rows. Documentation style hints remain applicable to table rows and are passed through to renderer styling where implemented. Blank-line table termination remains supported for backward compatibility.
- Added table syntax documentation to the Documentation Generator preface and expanded `doc-template.sh` with a compact documentation-dialect reference covering section indicators, documentation item/header indicators, style hints, image blocks, and table blocks.
- Added multi-product release preparation to `prepare-release.sh`. A release run can select multiple development products, choose a primary product, create individual product packages, and create a combined bundle from the same preparation workflow.
- Added per-product release metadata handling in `prepare-release.sh`: each selected product carries its own product identity, version, and Version/Build update policy. Version is entered per product; Build continues to use the standard day-of-year plus hour build number.
- Added product ownership collision detection while assembling bundles. Conflicting paths owned by different selected products now stop preparation with the primary product, companion product, and conflicting file reported explicitly.
- Added package discovery to `release-manager.sh`, allowing the Release Manager to select between bundled and individual product packages and to maintain project-specific release/archive state.
- Added GitHub release discovery for project packages using each project's configured repository.

<!-- -->

- Added development-context indicators to `management-console`, showing the console host and console application as `DEV` when running from non-production roots while remaining hidden during normal production use.
- Added console application context detection to `management-console`.
- Introduced `SGND_CONSOLE_APP_ROOT`, derived from the active `--appcfg` path.
- Added application-local executable resolution so development console modules can use executables from the same staged project tree while continuing to use the installed SolidGroundUX framework runtime.
- Added development-context indicators to the console index when either the console host or console application is running from a non-production root; indicators remain hidden in normal production use.

### Changed

- Reworked the interactive documentation-generator workflow around product discovery, product selection, primary-product selection, generation mode, source selection, collection metadata, output location, and behavioral flags.
- Documentation source directories are now derived from the selected products rather than entered independently. The primary product is processed first and supplies the lead collection defaults while companion products retain their own identities.
- Documentation generation now distinguishes creating a Full collection from updating one: a new Full collection starts clean, while a Full update loads the existing cache and refreshes the selected products without clearing the collection. Selected and Changed modes update only affected cached modules; Render mode bypasses source parsing.
- Changed-mode documentation generation now uses Git changes relative to `HEAD`, including untracked matching files.
- Documentation image captions are being standardized as descriptive, unnumbered captions rather than manually maintained figure numbers.
- Updated the SDK Documentation Generator, SolidGroundUX framework, Deployment, and Management Console Modules prefaces for the current 2.1 architecture, including product-aware documentation/release workflows, framework ROOT/NON-ROOT behavior, and clearer Management Console module/action structure.
- Documentation assets are no longer assumed to live beneath a SolidGroundUX-specific library path; each selected product contributes assets from its own canonical `usr/local/assets` directory.
- `prepare-release.sh` now derives bundle Version and Build from the primary product; bundle identity is never prompted or maintained separately.
- Product names used in generated release filenames are normalized to filesystem-safe names, including replacement of spaces with hyphens, while the human-readable Product value remains unchanged in package metadata and UI.
- Release Manager package selection uses package metadata rather than asking the operator to enter Version or Build values.
- Release Manager repository values are retained as project/package state and reused when that package is selected again.
- Release Manager project handling now supports both the SolidGroundUX framework and separately released SolidGroundUX applications such as Management Console Modules through the same lifecycle engine.

<!-- -->

- Changed comment-header section parsing to terminate at the first empty comment line, preventing subsequent header sections from being included in multiline metadata such as `Description`.
- Changed `management-console` executable resolution to prefer the active console application's executable directories before falling back to framework-owned executable locations.
- Changed `create-workspace` to mark canonical templates copied into a new workspace with a caveat identifying them as workspace-local canonical starter templates that should only be changed deliberately.
- Kept the installed canonical template sources unchanged; the caveat is added only to the copies placed in the newly created workspace.

# Build 2.1.2625621

### Changed

- Executable rights granted on release-manager and motd

# Build 2.1.2624123

## SolidGround Framework

### Added

- Added canonical bootstrap source normalization for release preparation. Executable `_framework_locator` functions and reusable-library guard sections can now be materialized from canonical source fragments instead of being maintained independently across the tree.
- Added argument-parser support for extracting recognized framework built-ins while preserving script-specific options and positional arguments in their original order for the later script-level parse.

### Changed

- Simplified executable bootstrap root discovery for the 2.1 architecture. `SGND_FRAMEWORK_ROOT` is now derived directly from the physical script path using the last canonical top-level `usr`, `etc`, or `var` component, allowing the same bootstrap code to resolve both installed `/` and staged/development trees.
- Reworked bootstrap argument processing so framework built-ins and script-specific arguments may be freely intermixed; callers no longer need to place framework options before application options.
- Script argument parsing now continues across positional values, allowing valid options to occur later on the command line. The standard `--` marker remains the hard end-of-options boundary and everything following it is treated as positional data.
- Script command-line values are applied after configuration/state loading so explicit CLI values take precedence without a later parser pass resetting previously parsed framework flags.
- Updated bootstrap and argument-parser documentation to describe argument extraction, ordering independence, precedence, preservation behavior, and `--` semantics.
- Framework smoke-test utility actions now continue the numbered menu sequence instead of using `L`, `V`, and `A`, avoiding collisions with framework/console shortcut keys; the timed smoke-test reader now accepts multi-digit selections.

### Repaired

- Repaired project-specific GitHub release checks for separately packaged products after validating repository visibility and repository-specific release endpoints.
- Repaired project package identity so Version and Build are obtained from prepared package metadata rather than being treated as Release Manager input.

<!-- -->

- Repaired canonical library-guard normalization so the next top-level source section is detected whether or not whitespace exists before its separator run, preventing sections such as `Minimal UI` from being consumed during normalization.
- Repaired canonical library guards for early bootstrap libraries by making metadata initialization conditional until `sgnd_module_init_metadata` is available.
- Repaired repeated argument parsing that could reset a previously recognized script flag such as `--auto` during bootstrap, causing unattended tools to fall back into interactive behavior.

## Development Tools

### Added

- Added optional canonical-source normalization to `prepare-release.sh`, executed before release metadata processing so generated bootstrap/guard fragments are normalized before checksums and release artifacts are produced.

### Changed

- Canonical normalization skips the canonical fragment directory itself, validates modified shell files with `bash -n`, and reports changes through checksum comparison.
- `prepare-release.sh` invokes canonical normalization in unattended mode and propagates dry-run behavior when release preparation is running as a dry run.

## Release Management

### Added

- Added project-aware release packages. Every release ZIP now carries a `release-package.info` shipping label containing package format, project slug, product, version, build, and release identity.
- Added generic project package support to `release-manager.sh`. Additional projects keep independent release and archive state beneath `/var/lib/solidgroundux/projects/<project>/`, while SolidGroundUX retains its existing release-state layout.
- Added standalone, stateful Release Manager parameters for target root, project, package source, release selector, repository, and state root. Accepted interactive values are reused as defaults on later runs.
- Added a standalone Release Manager UI fallback based on the SolidGroundUX default theme for bootstrap and recovery scenarios where the framework is not available.
- Added opportunistic use of the normal SolidGroundUX UI primitives and active theme when a healthy framework is available at the selected target root.
- Added project selection to the interactive Release Manager while retaining command-line actions for check, download, update, install, rollback, and removal.
- Added package-source installation support so a ZIP file or URL can be admitted and installed directly through the same release engine.

### Changed

- `prepare-release.sh` now resolves project identity from the project definitions file, updates version/build identity in the appropriate definitions file, and packages generic projects without bundling `release-manager.sh`.
- SolidGroundUX release ZIPs continue to include `release-manager.sh` as the first-install bootstrap entry point; generic project ZIPs rely on an already installed Release Manager.
- The ZIP-root Release Manager is now treated as a bootstrap runner rather than the authoritative installed copy. Installing the SolidGroundUX tar establishes `/var/lib/solidgroundux/release-manager.sh`.
- Release Manager startup no longer copies the currently executing script over the canonical installed manager merely because it is running from another path.
- Interactive Release Manager operation is parameter-driven and menu-based; non-interactive arguments select the same underlying menu actions rather than maintaining a separate workflow.
- The SolidGroundUX Management Console now delegates release lifecycle operations to a single **Release manager** menu item instead of duplicating check, download, update, install, rollback, and remove actions.
- Release preparation keeps build output in the workspace release directory instead of duplicating release artifacts into `target-root/var/lib/solidgroundux/releases`; the Release Manager admits package artifacts into managed release state when they are actually acquired or installed.
- Release Manager root handling now distinguishes the running bootstrap copy from the selected installation target. A bootstrap copy defaults the target root to `/` and asks explicitly in interactive mode; an installed canonical manager can derive the default target root from its location.
- The Release Manager remains usable when the framework is absent or damaged: standalone primitives are always available, and framework UI integration is strictly optional.

### Repaired

- Repaired Release Manager self-install behavior that could attempt to copy a development or bootstrap copy over `/var/lib/solidgroundux/release-manager.sh` and fail with permission errors.
- Repaired project-aware package admission so release artifacts are moved only after ZIP extraction into temporary staging, not as an unconditional startup side effect.
- Repaired Release Manager project-menu presentation and product-specific remove labeling after the project-aware refactor.

# Build 2.0.2623817

## Added

- Added root-only **Module metadata** (`M`) to the Management Console index. It shows metadata for modules that have actually been lazy-loaded in the current console session.
- Added reusable `--again` support to `ask_dlg_autocontinue`, allowing **A** to immediately repeat a workflow instead of waiting for the timeout.
- Added Samba share subdirectory management:
- Create subdirectories beneath selected shares.
- Accept relative paths such as `Files/Mark` and create intermediate directories.
- List subdirectories beneath selected shares.
- Remove selected subdirectories without allowing the share root itself to be removed.
- Reuse the current share selection; prompt for a share only when none is selected.
- Added Web Server site-management and publishing support:
- Create, enable, disable, remove, and list Nginx sites.
- Remove site content independently from site configuration.
- Publish content from a local directory or a remote machine.
- Persist publish-source answers as state.
- Configure a web address (`server_name`) separately from the site name/document-root directory.
- Publish generated SolidGroundUX documentation through the Web Server module.
- Register site hostnames in Active Directory DNS when requested.
- Added SQL Server configuration actions for storage, TCP network, memory, service management, firewall, tools, validation, and detailed status reporting.

## Changed

- Improved Management Console numbering so single- and multi-digit selections remain aligned on both module pages and the top-level console index.
- Improved Management Console state-file handling so switching **STANDARD → ROOT → STANDARD** keeps console state owned by the invoking user and prevents root-owned `0600` state files from blocking later writes.
- Main-console and **Manage visibility** `Select option :` prompts now use the active theme label color; typed selections continue to use the active theme value color.
- Web Server management is organized around separate site configuration, site content publishing, and SolidGroundUX documentation publishing concerns.
- Web Server site creation now defaults the web address from the local hostname/FQDN rather than from the site name.
- Web Server publishing no longer treats removed site definitions as publishable targets; publish selections are rebuilt from the current live Nginx site configuration.
- Remote Web Server publishing now supports explicit source host, source user, and source directory values and uses SSH key-based non-interactive access.
- SQL Server storage configuration now shows the directory-selection menu correctly, identifies the actual directory in create confirmations, and asks once whether SQL Server should be restarted after applying all storage changes.
- SQL Server status now reads the persisted `/var/opt/mssql/mssql.conf` settings so configured data, log, backup, and memory values can be shown instead of generic defaults.
- Samba subdirectory creation now inherits the selected share's existing ownership/permission/ACL model instead of assigning ownership based on the directory name.
- Active Directory Management repeat workflows now support **A = another** in addition to the existing timeout repeat behavior.
- Renamed MOTD file to `95-solidgroundux`; `update-motd.d` filenames must be lowercase-compatible with `run-parts --lsbsysinit`, and the SolidGroundUX block is intentionally displayed near the end.
- Added option to create directories, allowing a name, a path, or a comma-separated list as input to the storage module. *DONE*
- `www` → create under the configured storage root, e.g. `/srv/storage/www`
- `/srv/storage/www` → use exactly that path
- `www,logs,backup` → create all three under the configured storage root
- `/srv/www,/srv/logs` → create the explicit paths as given
- Mixed input should work too
- Use `ask_selection` to list existing directories; allow manual entry, and offer to create the directory when the entered value does not exist
- Adapted the filters in `prepare-release.sh` to exclude state, configuration, logging, and archive data.
- Release Manager bootstrap/configuration writing now uses explicit `printf` output instead of a heredoc.

## Repaired

- Repaired SQL Server storage selection where the selection menu was being swallowed by command substitution and only a bare `Selection` prompt remained visible.
- Repaired SQL Server status reporting for configured storage paths and memory values under both ROOT and STANDARD console sessions.
- Repaired Web Server site creation where the site name was incorrectly reused as the default web address.
- Repaired Web Server publishing state so removed sites no longer remain in the publish-site selection.
- Repaired remote Web Server publishing diagnostics around SSH host verification, key authentication, source user, and source-directory availability.
- Repaired Samba subdirectory creation so an already selected share is used directly instead of unnecessarily returning to share selection.
- Repaired console action/module state ownership across privilege switching.

## Verified

- Re-ran end-to-end provisioning from clean clones for `td-pdc`, `td-nas`, `td-sql`, and `td-web`; all four roles were configured successfully in approximately 34 minutes including unattended time, with the active work itself fitting within a sub-30-minute run.
- Verified generated SolidGroundUX documentation can be published through Nginx and reached through an Active Directory DNS hostname.
- Verified SQL Server 2025 installation and runtime status on Ubuntu 24.04, including active service, TCP 1433, configured memory limit, and configured data/log/backup paths.

# Build 2.0.2623404

## Verified

- SolidGroundUX was developed on Ubunto 26.04, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS compatibility verified — SolidGroundUX 2.0 installed and ran successfully.
- SQL Server 2025 module verified end-to-end on Ubuntu 24.04 — repository configuration, engine installation/configuration, tools, validation and status all working; SQL Server active and listening on TCP 1433.
- nginx module verified end-to-end on Ubuntu 26.04 — installation, configuration, validation and HTTP serving working; site-management and publishing capabilities remain limited.

## Changed

- Improved Samba File Server and share-management usability:
- Removed printer-share validation from the Samba file-server validation path.
- Added repeat-operation flows for creating and removing Samba shares.
- Added share selection when removing managed shares.
- Updated the Samba share manager to use `ask_selection` for share and Active Directory group selection.
- Active Directory groups are now discovered directly from the directory through LDAP instead of relying on NSS group enumeration.
- LDAP group discovery uses Kerberos/GSSAPI authentication and disables SASL hostname canonicalization so the registered domain-controller LDAP service principal is used correctly.
- Active Directory realm names are normalized to uppercase for Kerberos authentication while NSS group identities retain their resolvable `group@domain` form.
- The share manager now detects a missing Kerberos ticket and interactively authenticates an Active Directory user before querying directory groups.

<!-- -->

- Added `R Reset` to the management console, allowing last-run result markers to be cleared for the current module page without affecting results on other pages.

<!-- -->

- Moved manual console redraw from `R` to `Ctrl+R`; redraw continues to re-measure the terminal and invalidate layout-dependent caches.

<!-- -->

- Updated the console key legend to show `R Reset` and `Ctrl+R Redraw`.

<!-- -->

- Added a `--legend` argument to `ask_dlg_autocontinue`, allowing callers to replace the generic key legend with workflow-specific instructions.

<!-- -->

- Improved Active Directory Management usability:
- Added consistent `Q` / Quit handling to framework-owned prompts.
- Added `--back` support to `ask` so free-text prompts can return cleanly without assigning or validating the entered value.
- Removed redundant confirmation prompts from user and group creation/deletion flows where choosing the action and selecting/entering the object already expresses intent.
- Added optional “password never expires” handling during user creation.
- Added a dedicated “Set password never expires” user action.
- Added repeat-operation loops for:
- Create user
- Delete user
- Remove user from groups
- Create group
- Add users to group
- Remove group members
- Delete group
- Repeat-operation dialogs now use custom legends so timeout and Enter behavior are described accurately.
- Disabled the normal menu post-action wait for actions that now manage their own repeat/return flow.

<!-- -->

- Improved console width handling:
- Terminal width is re-measured on redraw.
- Rendering no longer relies on a separately cached menu width.
- Layout caches are invalidated on redraw so resized terminals are recalculated correctly.
- Non-interactive processes no longer fail when `/dev/tty` is unavailable.

## Repaired

- Repaired Storage provisioning confirmation handling:
- Fixed remaining Yes/No comparisons that expected mixed-case values instead of the canonical `YES` / `NO` responses returned by `ask_decision`.
- Verified storage provisioning now completes partitioning, filesystem creation, persistent `/etc/fstab` configuration, mounting, and creation of `/srv/storage/shares`.
- Verified storage status correctly reports the configured source, filesystem, UUID, mount state, persistence, read/write state, capacity, and available space.

<!-- -->

- Repaired Samba File Server provisioning and validation:
- Removed validation of Samba printer shares, which are not part of the managed SolidGroundUX file-server configuration.
- Verified the Samba preparation sequence completes successfully against provisioned SolidGroundUX storage.
- Repaired managed share creation and removal workflows.

<!-- -->

- Repaired Active Directory group handling in the Samba share manager:
- Fixed AD group discovery on realmd/SSSD domain members where `getent group` cannot enumerate directory groups even though direct qualified-name lookups work.
- Replaced unsuitable `samba-tool group list` discovery, which expects a local Active Directory database when run on a member server.
- Avoided `net ads group`, which requires Samba ADS membership configuration not present on the realmd/SSSD client.
- Added authenticated LDAP group discovery using the domain controller advertised through the Active Directory LDAP SRV record.
- Fixed Kerberos authentication failures caused by using a lowercase realm; authentication now uses the canonical uppercase realm such as `TESTADURA.HQ`.
- Fixed LDAP/GSSAPI service-ticket lookup by disabling SASL hostname canonicalization with `ldapsearch -N`.
- Verified LDAP group enumeration against the domain controller and NSS resolution of selected qualified AD groups.

<!-- -->

- Repaired Computer Setup validation:
- Corrected the sudoers file path used for SolidGroundUX receiver access.
- Centralized the sudoers filename in `SGND_COMPUTER_SUDOERS_FILE`.
- Verified setup, status, and validation all reference the same sudoers policy file.

<!-- -->

- Fully tested and repaired the Computer Setup workflow, including the automated preparation sequence.

<!-- -->

- Fully tested and repaired Active Directory provisioning:
- Fixed `ask_decision` case handling where canonical responses are returned in uppercase.
- Restored the automated provisioning sequence so it continues beyond preflight validation.
- Verified the remaining provisioning steps can complete successfully.

<!-- -->

- Repaired Active Directory Management confirmation handling:
- Fixed Yes/No comparisons so canonical `YES` / `NO` values are handled correctly.
- Fixed Quit handling so `Q` actually exits the current action instead of falling through.
- Fixed timeout handling in repeat-operation dialogs so timeout repeats the action instead of returning to the menu.

<!-- -->

- Repaired terminal-width detection for non-interactive receiver execution:
- Fixed `/dev/tty` probing so receiver-side operations no longer emit `No such device or address`.
